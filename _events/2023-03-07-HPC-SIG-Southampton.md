The closest hotel to the venue is the Highfield House Hotel, a 5 – 10 minute walk away. Then there is a Travelodge on Lodge Road, which is about a mile away from Highfield campus via a walk past the  venue Campus or a walk down Portswood road. If those are busy there are options such as a Jury’s Inn close to the city centre, and a bus down to the campus is probably the best bet.
