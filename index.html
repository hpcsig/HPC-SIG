<p>The HPC Special Interest Group aims to promote the use of High Performance Computing (HPC) and other forms of high end computing, such as high throughput computing (HTC) in academia, by members working together and promoting best practice in HPC provision, management and support. It also seeks to promote the uptake of HPC and HTC in industry through collaborations and consultancy between academia and industrial partners.</p>

<p>The HPC-SIG organises a range of meetings, events and workshops that are relevant to all current or potential providers of University HPC services.</p>

<p>The HPC-SIG maintains links with a range of affiliated and related organisations, including as JISC, STFC, CASC and others in the UK and internationally.</p>

<p>Over the last ten years, computational science has emerged as a major driver for innovation across the research spectrum. In fields as diverse as pharmaceuticals and nanotechnology, High Performance Computing (HPC) has dramatically accelerated the delivery of scientific insights; simulation and modelling supplanting traditional experimental-based methods through their cost efficiency.</p>
