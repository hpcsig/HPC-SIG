For general enquiries or to register interest in joining the HPC-SIG as a new institution please get in touch via HPC-SIG-ENQUIRIES at JISCMAIL.AC.UK

There is an annual membership fee for each institution that is a member of the HPC-SIG, currently (June 2016) £150 p.a., to cover meeting costs. The membership fee is payable once per institution, with each institution nominating a single Primary Member responsible for payment of the fee and to whom an invoice will be sent, if required. All current or potential providers of University HPC services are welcome to join as full voting members. Voting, with one vote per member institution, is infrequently used as a method of making decisions, and will only take place during HPC-SIG meetings.

There is no limit to the number of Secondary Members in each institution, but the expectation is that no more than one or two members would attend any particular HPC-SIG meeting. The Primary Member will be responsible for approving requests from their site to join the HPC-SIG as a secondary member,  providing details of the institution’s Secondary Members and will act as a single point of contact for that institution.

To join the HPC-SIG as a secondary member of an existing institution please subscribe to the JISCMail HPC-SIG list using a UK University address (ac.uk domain). Requests will not be accepted from generic address such as gmail or hotmail, or ISP-provided domains. Your request is referred to the primary member for that institution for approval and, if approved, the list owner will add you to the list.

Payment of the fee is a requirement for continuing membership of the HPC-SIG. New institutions will not be required to pay before attending their first meeting, but payment would be expected before attending their second meeting. Payment is by Purchase Card or Credit Card only, via the University of Strathclyde Online Shop.

Voting members will have access to password-protected sections of the group’s Web site, which will be used as a repository for “sensitive” or “confidential” information related to the group’s activities.

The HPC-SIG welcomes membership from non-academic providers and users of HPC facilities as Affiliate members. Affiliate members will be required to pay the membership fee and will be able to attend all HPC-SIG meetings, but will not have voting rights. Voting members will be able to vote on whether specific affiliate member organisations will be allowed to join the HPC-SIG, if required.

HPC hardware and software vendors are not permitted to be members of the SIG though they may be invited to participate in meetings for specific purposes, such as giving product presentations. Such invitations will be at the discretion of the HPC-SIG members, and will only be sent following discussion between the members.
