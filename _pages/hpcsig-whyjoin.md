<p>The HPC-SIG aims to hold three in person meetings per year, generally located across the country at UK University member sites and meetings are hybrid where possible. As well as the HPC-SIG meetings, focussed workshops are often held alongside the main meeting. Additional online technical focussed events have been held in the period between in-person meetings.</p>

<p>In-person meetings feature both technical and strategic/management streams, providing a useful discussion forum and opportunity to network and develop links with the HPC community from across UK academia.</p>
